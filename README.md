# Project 1 DataQuest: Exploring eBay Car Sales
## Project Description:
- Analyzed the German Car Sales market on eBay: eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website;
- The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle by user orgesleka. The original dataset isnâ€™t available on Kaggle anymore. You can find it via DataQuest
- Original Dataset was edited for learning purposes:
  - Sampled 50,000 data points from the full dataset, to ensure your code runs quickly in our hosted environment;
  - Dirtied the dataset a bit to more closely resemble what you would expect from a scraped dataset (the version uploaded to Kaggle was cleaned to be easier to work with)
