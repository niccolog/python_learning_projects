Job summary
A fulfillment center can appear to be a chaotic place. With millions of items moving in and out of an area twice as large as your average theme park every day, a quick peek under the roof would reveal a manic scene. You would see associates, machinery, vehicles, robots, and packages flying about at break-neck speeds and accessing a breathtaking number of shelves and bins that store products. In reality, however, this activity is all highly organized and orchestrated by software, with each movement carefully planned and optimized. However, there are times when mistakes occur: products may disappear, reappear in strange places, become damaged, or worse. When that happens, how does a fulfillment center operating at that size, speed, and scale recover gracefully and with minimal cost? How do we ensure that we meet our commitments to our customers and merchants? How do we find a needle in a haystack when we’re constantly shuffling the haystack around? And how do we do it at extreme scale in an environment of constant growth?

The Fulfillment AI team operates at a nexus of machine learning, computer vision, statistics, optimization, and healthy measure of hard-earned expertise in operations to build automated, algorithmic approaches to solving these problems at minimal cost. We create cutting edge software, building automated processes and workflows in the most complex operational problem space in the business world. So what should you expect from this role?

As a Data Scientist you will be working in one of the world's largest and most complex data analytics environments. You should have deep expertise in analyzing huge data sets from multiple domains. You should be expert at designing and implementing solutions that use a range of data science methodologies to automate data analysis or to solve complex business problems. You will design metrics for complex systems. You will deep dive ML training data and feature sets to drive improvements. You will partner with Research and Applied Scientists, SDEs, Technical Program Managers, Product Managers, and business leaders to identify solutions to large problems in Amazon Operations.

Your analysis and solution recommendations will drive system optimizations with global impact. You will develop metrics to quantify the benefits of a solution and influence project resources. You will audit metric data and use it to measure system impact and performance.

You will harness massive and diverse data sets to mine actionable insights for senior leaders. You will automate data feeds, validate the data input and analyze trends that lead to cost saving initiatives. In this role, you will own solving problems through deep data review, statistical analyses, and creation of analytic tools usable by others on the team. Your work products will guide our reporting, benchmarking, program optimization, financial planning, and execution strategy.

The ideal candidate is a motivated self-starter who can thrive in a fast-paced environment. They will enjoy working in a multidisciplinary team of engineers, scientists and business leaders. They will seek to understand processes behind data so their recommendations are grounded.

Job summary
A fulfillment center can appear to be a chaotic place. With millions of items moving in and out of an area twice as large as your average theme park every day, a quick peek under the roof would reveal a manic scene. You would see associates, machinery, vehicles, robots, and packages flying about at break-neck speeds and accessing a breathtaking number of shelves and bins that store products. In reality, however, this activity is all highly organized and orchestrated by software, with each movement carefully planned and optimized. However, there are times when mistakes occur: products may disappear, reappear in strange places, become damaged, or worse. When that happens, how does a fulfillment center operating at that size, speed, and scale recover gracefully and with minimal cost? How do we ensure that we meet our commitments to our customers and merchants? How do we find a needle in a haystack when we’re constantly shuffling the haystack around? And how do we do it at extreme scale in an environment of constant growth?

The Fulfillment AI team operates at a nexus of machine learning, computer vision, statistics, optimization, and healthy measure of hard-earned expertise in operations to build automated, algorithmic approaches to solving these problems at minimal cost. We create cutting edge software, building automated processes and workflows in the most complex operational problem space in the business world. So what should you expect from this role?

As a Data Scientist you will be working in one of the world's largest and most complex data analytics environments. You should have deep expertise in analyzing huge data sets from multiple domains. You should be expert at designing and implementing solutions that use a range of data science methodologies to automate data analysis or to solve complex business problems. You will design metrics for complex systems. You will deep dive ML training data and feature sets to drive improvements. You will partner with Research and Applied Scientists, SDEs, Technical Program Managers, Product Managers, and business leaders to identify solutions to large problems in Amazon Operations.

Your analysis and solution recommendations will drive system optimizations with global impact. You will develop metrics to quantify the benefits of a solution and influence project resources. You will audit metric data and use it to measure system impact and performance.

You will harness massive and diverse data sets to mine actionable insights for senior leaders. You will automate data feeds, validate the data input and analyze trends that lead to cost saving initiatives. In this role, you will own solving problems through deep data review, statistical analyses, and creation of analytic tools usable by others on the team. Your work products will guide our reporting, benchmarking, program optimization, financial planning, and execution strategy.

The ideal candidate is a motivated self-starter who can thrive in a fast-paced environment. They will enjoy working in a multidisciplinary team of engineers, scientists and business leaders. They will seek to understand processes behind data so their recommendations are grounded.

Flexibility
It isn’t about which hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We offer flexibility and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth
We care about your career growth too. Whether your goals are to explore new technologies, take on bigger opportunities, or get to the next level, we'll help you get there. Our business is growing fast and our people will grow with it.

3+ years of experience with data scripting languages (e.g SQL, Python, R etc.) or statistical/mathematical software (e.g. R, SAS, or Matlab)
2 years working as a Data Scientist
Experienced in handling large data sets using SQL and databases in a business environment.
Job summary
A fulfillment center can appear to be a chaotic place. With millions of items moving in and out of an area twice as large as your average theme park every day, a quick peek under the roof would reveal a manic scene. You would see associates, machinery, vehicles, robots, and packages flying about at break-neck speeds and accessing a breathtaking number of shelves and bins that store products. In reality, however, this activity is all highly organized and orchestrated by software, with each movement carefully planned and optimized. However, there are times when mistakes occur: products may disappear, reappear in strange places, become damaged, or worse. When that happens, how does a fulfillment center operating at that size, speed, and scale recover gracefully and with minimal cost? How do we ensure that we meet our commitments to our customers and merchants? How do we find a needle in a haystack when we’re constantly shuffling the haystack around? And how do we do it at extreme scale in an environment of constant growth?

The Fulfillment AI team operates at a nexus of machine learning, computer vision, statistics, optimization, and healthy measure of hard-earned expertise in operations to build automated, algorithmic approaches to solving these problems at minimal cost. We create cutting edge software, building automated processes and workflows in the most complex operational problem space in the business world. So what should you expect from this role?

As a Data Scientist you will be working in one of the world's largest and most complex data analytics environments. You should have deep expertise in analyzing huge data sets from multiple domains. You should be expert at designing and implementing solutions that use a range of data science methodologies to automate data analysis or to solve complex business problems. You will design metrics for complex systems. You will deep dive ML training data and feature sets to drive improvements. You will partner with Research and Applied Scientists, SDEs, Technical Program Managers, Product Managers, and business leaders to identify solutions to large problems in Amazon Operations.

Your analysis and solution recommendations will drive system optimizations with global impact. You will develop metrics to quantify the benefits of a solution and influence project resources. You will audit metric data and use it to measure system impact and performance.

You will harness massive and diverse data sets to mine actionable insights for senior leaders. You will automate data feeds, validate the data input and analyze trends that lead to cost saving initiatives. In this role, you will own solving problems through deep data review, statistical analyses, and creation of analytic tools usable by others on the team. Your work products will guide our reporting, benchmarking, program optimization, financial planning, and execution strategy.

The ideal candidate is a motivated self-starter who can thrive in a fast-paced environment. They will enjoy working in a multidisciplinary team of engineers, scientists and business leaders. They will seek to understand processes behind data so their recommendations are grounded.

At Amazon Glow we are connecting children and remote loved ones in innovative ways to support their development and relations. We do this by tackling problems that span a variety of domains: Natural Language Generation (NLG), Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Human-Computer-Interaction and real-time systems.

#GlowCareers

As a Machine Learning and Computer Vision Applied Scientist you will help solve a variety of technical challenges and mentor other team members while actively following our entrepreneurial culture that encourages us to wear many hats. You will play an active role in leading translation of business and functional requirements into concrete deliverables. Build quick prototypes and proofs of concept in partnership with other technology leaders within the team. Improve products and concepts as a direct result of your research while delivering significant benefits to business.

You are well versed in the relevant literature and will have the ability to find, understand and adapt new state of the art methods from the core discipline as well as beyond to create breakthrough problem-solution pairs. You will tackle challenging, novel situations every day and you’ll have the opportunity to work with other technical teams at Amazon within and outside the organization. You should be comfortable with a degree of ambiguity that’s higher than most projects and relish the idea of solving problems that haven’t been dreamed up and much less solved at scale before - anywhere. Along the way, you’ll learn a ton, have fun and make a positive impact on millions of people.

This early-stage initiative is tackling problems that span a variety of domains: Natural Language Generation (NLG), Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Human-Computer-Interaction and real-time systems.

Here at Amazon, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/life Balance
Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Key job responsibilities
Turn problems into creative solutions that are productizable. Via the combination of latest state of the art methods, new innovations and experimentation and validation. You would make proof of concepts to showcase the way the solution works and work closely with Software Developers to turn these prototypes into products that are launched.

Amazon is committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace.
