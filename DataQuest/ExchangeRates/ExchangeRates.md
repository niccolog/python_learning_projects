# Exchange Rates
## Storytelling with data: Project Description
This short project with Dataquest is designed to visualize Exchange Rates between EUR and other currencies between 1999 and 2020. 
With this project we are going to import EUR exchange rates from the ECB (European Central Bank), take an exploratory look at the data, then decide what kind of analysis we are going to do.
