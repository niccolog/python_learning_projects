# Guided Project - Predicting Bike Rentals
## Project Introduction
In this project we will try to predict the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour. We will predict the cnt column using all of the other columns, except for casual and registered. To accomplish this, we will create a few different machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
## Project Conclusion
We tested Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest and verified that in this case a Random Forest provides both the best accuracy and lowest overfitting.
