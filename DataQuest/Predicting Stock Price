# DataQuest Guided Project - Predicting Stock Price
## Project Intro
We are going to work witn SP500 index data and use clustering to predict stock market prices.
## Project Results
A simple Linear Model returned RMSE of 21.98 with few features related to closing price only and rolling averages. 
Adding indicators related to volume and trailing min/max prices over a year decreased the model precision.
