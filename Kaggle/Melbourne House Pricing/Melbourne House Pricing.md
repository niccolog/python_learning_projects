# Kaggle Intermediated Machine Learning Course
[Final Notebook](https://github.com/niccolog/python_learning_projects/blob/main/Kaggle/Melbourne%20House%20Pricing/Melbourne_House_Pricing_Kaggle_project_clean_1.ipynb)
## Project Description
Build a model to predict the House Price in the Melbourne Housing Market.
## Project Conclusions
Using the optimized XGBoost model delivers a good 14438.50162 score which is, at the moment I am redacting this notebook, good for position #254. This performance is way better than all other models previously used Random Forest and Decision Tree and uplifted my position from mid table to almost top 1%.
